# VR Estranho Security Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the 12 critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the VR Estranho system.

## Fixed Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. ✅ Command Injection (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Arbitrary command execution through `/api/system/execute/:agentId` endpoint
**Fix**: 
- Implemented command whitelist with allowed commands and arguments
- Added input sanitization to prevent shell metacharacters
- Limited command execution timeout and output size
- Added role-based access control (admin/operator only)

### 2. ✅ Path Traversal (HIGH)
**Issue**: File operations allowed access to system directories
**Fix**:
- Added path validation middleware
- Blocked access to system directories (`/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`, etc.)
- Implemented secure path normalization
- Prevented overwriting critical system files

### 3. ✅ WebSocket Authentication (HIGH)
**Issue**: WebSocket connections accepted without authentication
**Fix**:
- Implemented JWT-based WebSocket authentication
- Added agent token validation for agent connections
- Proper connection verification and authorization

### 4. ✅ Insecure File Upload (HIGH)
**Issue**: No validation on uploaded files
**Fix**:
- Added MIME type validation with whitelist
- Implemented file size limits (100MB)
- Filename sanitization to prevent malicious names
- Target path validation

### 5. ✅ Agent Registration Security (HIGH)
**Issue**: Agents could register without proper authentication
**Fix**:
- Added agent token validation for registration
- Input validation for agent information
- IP address format validation

### 6. ✅ JWT Security Issues (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Hardcoded JWT secrets and weak token handling
**Fix**:
- Environment-based secret management
- Centralized configuration system
- Enhanced token validation with proper error handling
- Stronger password hashing (bcrypt cost 12)

### 7. ✅ Input Validation (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Missing input validation across endpoints
**Fix**:
- Comprehensive validation middleware
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Parameter length limits and format validation
- SQL injection prevention through sanitization

### 8. ✅ Error Information Disclosure (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Detailed error messages leaked system information
**Fix**:
- Environment-aware error handling
- Generic error messages in production
- Secure logging without sensitive data exposure

### 9. ✅ Process Control Security (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Agent restart could be triggered without proper authorization
**Fix**:
- Admin-only access with role validation
- Explicit confirmation requirement
- Enhanced logging with user attribution

### 10. ✅ CSRF Protection (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: No CSRF protection for state-changing operations
**Fix**:
- Custom CSRF token implementation
- Token validation for protected routes
- Secure token management with expiration

### 11. ✅ Configuration Security (LOW)
**Issue**: Hardcoded secrets and insecure defaults
**Fix**:
- Environment variable configuration
- Secure default password generation
- Configuration documentation and examples

### 12. ✅ Enhanced Security Headers (LOW)
**Issue**: Missing security headers
**Fix**:
- CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
- Enhanced CORS configuration
- Rate limiting improvements

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Required in production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-minimum-32-chars
AGENT_TOKEN=your-agent-authentication-token
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password

# Optional
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DB_PATH=./data/database.sqlite
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper expiration
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error responses
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
6. **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention
7. **Path Security**: Prevention of directory traversal
8. **Command Security**: Whitelisted command execution
9. **File Security**: Secure file upload and operations
10. **Configuration Security**: Environment-based secrets

### Testing Security Fixes

The system now includes:
- Command execution restricted to safe operations
- File operations limited to non-system directories
- Authenticated WebSocket connections
- Validated file uploads with type checking
- Secure error responses
- CSRF token protection
- Input sanitization throughout

### Deployment Security

For production deployment:
1. Set all required environment variables
2. Use HTTPS/WSS for all connections
3. Configure firewall rules appropriately
4. Monitor logs for security events
5. Regular security updates and patches

## Impact
These fixes address all 12 identified security vulnerabilities and significantly improve the system's security posture while maintaining full functionality.
